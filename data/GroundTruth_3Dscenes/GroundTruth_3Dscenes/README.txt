This folder contains the ground truth data for comparing results to the above two papers.

*.xf files contain a 4x4 homogenous coordinate matrix. The first 3 columns contain the orientation (rotation) and the last column contains the location (translation) of the object.

For example the file chef-rs4.xf contains the ground truth orientation and location of the chef model in scene 4.

occlusion.txt file contains the percentage occlusion of each object in the 50 scenes.
